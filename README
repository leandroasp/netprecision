To run the application you must have Docker and JRE 11+  installed. 

In application.properties change to "dev" if you want to use MySQL, and "test" to use an in-memory database.

In the /docs directory you have the front-end compiled.

In the application directory run the command:

```
./mvnw package
docker build -t springio/netprecision . 
docker-compose up
```

You can also run the application with an in-memory database without the docker, using the command:

```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
